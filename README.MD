This program parallelises both hot‑paths of the CPU miner entirely on GPU. Transactions are first hashed to leaves, then each Merkle level is reduced with one SHA‑256 per thread while nodes remain binary until the very last conversion to ASCII, cutting the tree time from  arpox. 0.30s to 0.03s. the kernel launches ⌈ (max_nonce+1)/256 ⌉ blocks so each thread usually tests a single nonce. it converts the nonce to decimal on‑chip, computes one SHA‑256 and compares the binary digest with the difficulty stored in constant memory, using an atomic once a valid hash is found.
